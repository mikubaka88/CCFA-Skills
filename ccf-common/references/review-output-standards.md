# CCFA Review And Output Standards

Use this shared reference when a CCFA skill produces review, scoring, risk diagnosis, revision priorities, or monitor-to-review handoff signals.

## Quantitative Feedback

When scores are appropriate, separate three values. Honor qualitative or no-score requests; selecting a reviewer does not require a numeric-score request:

- **Criterion score:** how strong the artifact is on one dimension, normally 1-5 unless the venue defines another scale.
- **Overall score or stance:** the calibrated decision-level result, normally 1-10 for paper review and weighted 1-5 or 1-10 for idea review.
- **Confidence:** how securely the decisive judgment could be checked, considering the inspected evidence and domain familiarity. State source coverage separately; having a full PDF does not establish certainty, and low confidence does not automatically mean a low score.

For each score of 3 or below on a 1-5 dimension scale, include the deduction and the condition that would move the score; use the corresponding low band on another scale. Do not give a number without an evidence basis. Use `N/A` for inapplicable criteria and `not assessed` for unavailable evidence; neither is zero. An unsupported claim identified in the reviewed material remains a substantive finding.

Idea review uses the conceptual rubric in `../../ccf-idea-reviewer/references/rubric.md`: no default experiment, result-completeness, or submission-readiness score. Manuscript scientific review checks actual claim support; writing-only review stays within writing criteria. Do not import a full-paper rubric merely because the input is a PDF.

Carry drafting phase into review. An internal alignment review of an intentionally results-pending initial draft evaluates explanation and consistency, not an imagined publication outcome; absent empirical adequacy is `not assessed`, not zero or a pass. It still flags any unsupported result assertion. A full submission review must state that empirical readiness is incomplete. A future venue page limit is not an active constraint on a content-first draft unless fitting was requested.

For manuscript re-review or cross-version comparison, freeze rubric dimensions, weights, anchors, reviewer roles, thresholds, and evidence standard before rescoring. Evaluate both versions under that contract. Keep two scorecards and one confidence statement separate:

1. **Relative-progress scorecard:** score the historical and current versions with the same frozen dimension scale, report every per-dimension delta and the weighted delta, and classify progress as `regressed`, `unchanged`, or `improved`. This scorecard answers only whether the revision improved the manuscript.
2. **Absolute-readiness scorecard:** assess the current manuscript against the target venue's publication standard and report its calibrated overall score or stance. This scorecard answers only how close the current manuscript is to acceptance quality.
3. **Confidence and comparability:** report evidence coverage, missing materials, reviewer consistency, and any external standard change. Do not fold this into either score.

Never average, add, or otherwise fuse the two scorecards. A revision may have a positive progress delta and still receive a low readiness score. Classify new concerns as revision regressions, previously undetected issues, newly revealed evidence, or external standard changes. A progress-score decrease must cite a current-version regression or newly revealed evidence; a latent issue already present applies consistently to both versions.

Reuse report-level confidence unless a dimension differs materially. Discuss possible score movement only when requested or useful to the decision, using values allowed by the chosen scale if a range is justified. A repair condition need not predict a score change. Do not guarantee a numerical increase or claim acceptance probability.

## Report Structure And Finding Quality

User-requested manuscript reports use `../../ccf-paper-reviewer/references/fixed-output-format.md`; concept reports use `../../ccf-idea-reviewer/references/strict-idea-review.md`. Each defines a detailed default and an explicit brief mode. A bounded internal contribution to another artifact returns its inspected scope, evidence-backed findings, unresolved concerns, and completion conditions to the integrating owner; it need not generate a separate scorecard or full report. This does not reduce the scope or structure of a requested review. The role blocks below are components, not extra mandatory reports.

Give each material concern a stable ID and one complete explanation: claim/location, inspected basis, why it matters, and a change condition. Check correctness, decision relevance, and support before retaining it. Distinguish a demonstrated contradiction, missing support for an asserted result, and unavailable input. Questions are not established defects. Do not inflate severity to sound strict.

Before saying something is absent, inspect the relevant supplied section and appendix or identify the coverage limit. On revision, verify changed material and unresolved concern IDs; retain resolved status and classify new findings. Do not duplicate the same objection in role reports, scorecards, and action tables.

## Multi-Reviewer Panel

An optional additional independent pass follows the effective `independent_review` preference in `preferences.md`; explicit user requests take priority. This does not switch off the primary review, evidence counterchecks, necessary specialist contributions, or fixed report structure. With `auto`, use a bounded independent pass for a consequential unresolved judgment or a requested pre-submission check where independent inspection can change the result. With `on`, prefer it for relevant substantial assessments, not for every local edit. Never expand concept-only review to experiment assessment merely because this preference is enabled.

When using actual independent reviewer calls, keep them independent before synthesis. If the host lacks or disallows delegation, use clearly labeled role-based perspectives within one agent; do not claim independent validation or empirical consensus. Each selected role should inspect a relevant distinct failure mode, use evidence from the idea, paper, manuscript text, or searched source, and state uncertainty when evidence is missing.

Required discipline:

- Do not force every reviewer to disagree.
- Do not force praise when no real strength is visible.
- Do not force rejection when the evidence does not support it.
- If a role finds no serious concern, say why and name the supporting evidence.
- If a role cannot judge, mark `insufficient evidence` and state what input would change that.
- Synthesis weighs the contribution and supported concerns under the selected rubric. A demonstrated fatal flaw cannot be averaged away; a speculative objection or a missing out-of-scope artifact is not a fatal flaw. Explain why a concern changes the stance instead of choosing the most negative wording.

## Output Quality Gate

Before returning a visible artifact, read the answer once as if it were going to the user unchanged.

Check:

1. The section order matches the promised output contract.
2. Every table has valid Markdown separators and the same number of columns in each row.
3. Scores, confidence, and recommendations are internally consistent.
4. Bullet lists use parallel grammar where possible: same part of speech, same level of detail, same action style.
5. Causal or progressive logic is explicit: problem -> reason -> consequence -> action.
6. Punctuation is consistent within the chosen language; avoid mixed full-width and half-width punctuation when it distracts from the result.
7. No placeholder such as `TBD`, `TODO`, `[fill]`, or empty heading remains unless it is intentionally marking missing user evidence.
8. No generic filler remains, such as "improve clarity", "needs more experiments", or "strengthen motivation" without the exact location, missing evidence, and action.

For Chinese outputs, prefer concise headings, complete table labels, and direct action verbs. For English outputs, prefer short declarative sentences and avoid inflated reviewer language.
