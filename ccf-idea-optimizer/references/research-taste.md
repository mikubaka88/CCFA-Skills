# Research Taste

Use this file when the user asks what kind of research is important, explanatory, elegant, or relevant to a research community.

## Good Research Signals

Strong research usually has:

- An important problem, not only a popular technique.
- A precise gap against strong prior work.
- A simple insight that changes how the problem is attacked.
- A method whose mechanism is inspectable.
- Evidence that tests the claim rather than decorating it.
- Honest scope and limitations.
- A result that would still teach something if the headline number were smaller.

## Research Questions

Use the relevant questions during idea optimization, without requiring an answer to every planning question before developing an early mechanism:

```text
What are you trying to do?
How is it done today?
What is new in your approach?
Who cares, and why?
Which known assumption or constraint could change the direction?
How much will it cost or require?
How will progress and success be measured?
```

## Intellectual Merit

Use intellectual merit as the core idea test:

- Does the idea advance knowledge, capability, method, data, theory, system design, or evaluation?
- Does its explanation identify a limitation or relationship that existing formulations miss?
- What observation, construction, or argument would separate it from the alternatives?

Resources and timeline guide execution choices. Keep them distinct from intellectual merit; assess real constraints without treating unfinished work as a weak idea.

Use broader impact only when it is real and venue-relevant. Do not add vague societal claims to compensate for weak technical contribution.

## Problem Choice

Prefer important problems where the user's current position offers a credible angle. Seek an attackable mechanism or decisive question within a difficult problem; do not automatically shrink its scientific ambition. Review readiness is one consideration, not a substitute for whether the result would advance understanding.

Importance can come from a concrete unmet need, a persistent unexplained phenomenon, a missing capability, or a theoretical barrier. Distinguish an explicit deployment requirement from an assumed preference for immediate applications. Basic research need not invent a customer story; application research should explain the actual task and the consequence of its current failure. Popularity, citation count, and the newest benchmark alone establish neither kind of value.

## Paper-Story Taste

Connect the research into an intelligible argument:

```text
problem -> gap -> challenge -> insight -> method -> appropriate support -> scientific takeaway
```

For an early idea, explain the proposed mechanism and its rationale; completed evidence comes later. Place material assumptions or observed limits where they change interpretation, without requiring a cautionary ending. Drafting can help sharpen missing links; do not repeatedly restart ideation merely because the whole story is not settled.

## Reader Questions

Venue fit matters alongside scientific value. Use concrete research questions to identify what the reader still needs to understand:

- Why this problem?
- Why this method?
- Why now?
- Which observation or argument supports the explanation?
- Why this venue?
- What would fail if the central assumption is false?

Use a missing answer to identify the affected question. Resolve material conceptual gaps during idea development; authorized writing can continue on supported content without repeatedly restarting ideation. Do not optimize indefinitely for imagined reviewer objections.

## Frontier And Staleness Taste

For fast-moving topics, a good idea should survive a current related-work scan. Treat these as warnings:

- The idea is a direct extension of a crowded benchmark trend with no new bottleneck.
- The method is "add LLM/VLM/diffusion/agent" without a mechanism tied to the problem.
- The claimed gap is likely solved by recent workshop, arXiv, OpenReview, or proceedings papers.
- The evidence package would only show small leaderboard gains without explaining why.
- The idea depends on an obsolete dataset, baseline, threat model, workload, or user scenario.

Prefer directions that:

- expose a new measurable failure mode,
- simplify an overcomplicated paradigm,
- connect a strong method to a neglected but important constraint,
- create a benchmark/protocol that changes what can be measured,
- turn an empirical observation into a mechanism, theorem, or system design.

## Acknowledgments

The question framework draws on Heilmeier's research questions, NSF's intellectual-merit criteria, and Hamming's discussion of important problems. Their source records remain in the [shared registry](../../ccf-common/references/source-registry.yaml). These acknowledgments preserve provenance without naming CCFA's methods after another framework.
