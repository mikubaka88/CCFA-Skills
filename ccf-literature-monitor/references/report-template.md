# Monitoring Report Template

This is the canonical structure for full monitoring reports. Honor a requested short answer or other user format, keeping the time range, source basis, and relevant changes; internal contributions return findings to the owner without a separate report. Full reports retain the fields below as applicable, without inventing counts, scores, or actions to fill them.

## Report Header

```markdown
## Literature Monitoring Report: [Monitoring Mode] - [Topic/Category]

**Date:** [YYYY-MM-DD]
**Time Range:** [from] to [to]
**Sources Scanned:** [arXiv categories / OpenReview venues / proceedings / labs / project pages]
**Query Basis:** [public-safe keywords or user-approved query text]
**Papers Scanned:** [count]
**High-Relevance Papers:** [count]
**Overall Signal:** RELAX / RESEARCH / FOLLOW-UP
**Confidence:** [1-5 with reason]
```

## Source Coverage

```markdown
| Source | Scope | Count | Notes |
|:---|:---|---:|:---|
| arXiv | [categories/queries] | [count] | [coverage limits] |
| OpenReview / venue | [venues] | [count] | [coverage limits] |
| Labs / competitors | [names] | [count] | [coverage limits] |
```

## Executive Summary

One paragraph summary of the monitoring result, including total papers scanned, number of high-relevance papers, overlap distribution, and the action supported by the findings. Do not claim that an idea is novel solely because no overlap appeared in the scanned window.

## High-Relevance Papers

Table of papers relevant to the requested watch. For novelty monitoring, use the overlap columns below. For trend scouting, replace irrelevant overlap columns with the new observation or useful mechanism and its relevance; do not fabricate a novelty threat to fit the table.

| # | Title | Source | Date | Overlap Score (0-5) | Overlap Level | Overlap Type | Evidence Basis | Recommended Action |
|:---:|:---|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---|:---|:---:|
| 1 | [Title] | [arXiv/OpenReview/Venue] | [YYYY-MM-DD] | [0-5] | None/Low/Medium/High | Problem/Method/Evidence/Benchmark | [abstract/intro/result] | RELAX/RESEARCH/FOLLOW-UP |
| 2 | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

## Detailed Findings

For each high-relevance paper, provide:

- **Title:** [full title]
- **URL:** [arXiv, OpenReview, proceedings, DOI, or project link]
- **Source/date:** [source and publication/preprint date]
- **Key contribution:** [what the paper claims or contributes]
- **Overlap rationale:** [why this overlaps or differs from the user's idea]
- **Uncertainty:** [what was not checked]
- **Action:** [RELAX | RESEARCH | FOLLOW-UP with reasoning]

## Trend Map

Summarize emerging trends and open gaps in the scanned sources. Separate observed trends from inferred opportunities.

## Flags for Other Skills

Include only useful flags with the specific gap or requested action: `RELAX` means no material overlap found in the scanned window, `RESEARCH` means partial overlap needing clarification when it affects the task, and `FOLLOW-UP` means substantial overlap with a decision to resolve. Neither label automatically starts another workflow. Relevant handoff fields are:

- `@ccf-literature-searcher`: [papers or clusters to retrieve deeply]
- `@ccf-idea-reviewer`: [novelty implications for idea score]
- `@ccf-idea-optimizer`: [differentiation or rescue routes]
- `@ccf-paper-writer`: [related-work or positioning updates]
- `@ccf-integrity-auditor`: [potential dependency or attribution issues]
