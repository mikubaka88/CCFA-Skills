# Venue Review Styles

Use this file after identifying the target venue or CCF-A family. Treat it as an evidence selector, not a substitute official form or a second generic rubric. Use the canonical seven dimensions in `calibration-and-rank.md` unless a verified venue form or frozen comparison contract specifies otherwise. If current-year policy, page limits, or official review forms matter, verify the official venue page first.

## AAAI

Primary dimensions: significance and novelty of contributions, theoretical or empirical soundness, relevance to the AAAI community, clarity, responsible research, and reproducibility.

Review emphasis:

- Reward substantive AI contribution, not just application packaging.
- Check whether the problem, method, experiments, analyses, and claims fit AAAI's broad AI audience.
- Require reproducibility details, proof/algorithm clarity, datasets, metrics, and responsible-research handling when relevant.
- Penalize unclear engagement with previous literature, unjustified AI-based approach, weak evaluation, or overbroad social-impact claims.

## NeurIPS

Primary dimensions: quality, clarity, significance, and originality, interpreted by contribution type.

Review emphasis:

- Match standards to contribution type: theory, dataset/evaluation, benchmark, concept/feasibility, empirical method, negative result, or analysis.
- Do not require SOTA empirical wins for theory-only papers, but require correctness and clear assumptions.
- For empirical work, inspect fair comparisons and honest limitations; request ablations or robustness tests when they resolve a particular central claim.
- Strong papers explain why others will use, build on, or learn from the result.

## ICML

Primary dimensions: technical quality, significance, novelty/originality, clarity, reproducibility, and fit to ML.

Review emphasis:

- Separate algorithmic or theoretical novelty from empirical performance.
- Require enough experimental breadth to justify general ML claims.
- Penalize weak statistical practice, missing strong baselines, unclear training/evaluation details, and overstated generalization.
- Reward clean problem formulation, theory/intuition, and evidence that explains why the method works.

## ICLR

Primary dimensions: value to the community, new knowledge, soundness, novelty, significance, clarity, and discussion responsiveness.

For 2027, use source records `iclr-2027-reviewer-guidelines` and `iclr-2027-ai-reviewers`. Keep CCFA's fixed report profile and seven-dimension rubric unless the user supplies a verified official form.

- Ask whether the submission brings sufficient value to the community.
- Ground the recommendation in the research question, motivation/prior work, support for claims, and significance. Assess theory, empirical work, and other contributions on their own evidence; a missing SOTA win alone is not a rejection reason.
- Lead with the one or two reasons driving the recommendation, while retaining every material concern. Group duplicate symptoms under stable finding IDs. Additional experiments must resolve a specific central claim; avoid peripheral requests and separate optional improvements from decision blockers. Do not shorten the required evidence inspection or change the fixed report headings.
- Reassess resolved concerns after discussion; explain any change in recommendation using new evidence.
- Verify dates against the current author guidelines: the 2027 reviewer FAQ contains an inconsistent deadline example. Do not turn its stale example into a mandatory comparison cutoff.

### ICLR 2027 Official Review Assistance

Distinguish an author's internal manuscript pre-review from an assigned official review or meta-review. For an official assignment, verify the current AI-review policy before generating or editing review text. Work from the human reviewer's own initial assessment; do not generate that initial self-report or invent independent reading. If it is missing, request it before drafting the official review. AI-assisted editing requires disclosure, the original assessment, and the interaction record, including inputs across iterative turns. Preserve these in the existing task paths and keep the final judgment consistent with the human assessment; flag substantive changes for the reviewer. Internal author pre-review continues under the normal CCFA contract and does not require an official-review self-report.

## ACL / ARR

Primary dimensions: soundness, excitement/usefulness, reproducibility, ethics, clarity, and fit for ACL readers.

Review emphasis:

- Soundness covers methodological validity, experimental design, annotation/data quality, linguistic or semantic validity, and evaluation validity.
- Excitement is more subjective; improve it through clear usefulness, insight, surprising finding, strong resource, new framing, or broad relevance.
- Reproducibility and responsible NLP details matter: data, annotation, human subjects, bias, societal impact, and checklist support.
- For resubmissions, explicitly show how prior review concerns were addressed.

## CVPR / ICCV / ECCV

Use the exact venue/year/track guidance rather than transferring rules across these venues. CVPR 2027 author-owned pre-review follows the ordinary internal-review scope; an assigned confidential review must observe the approved-tool boundary in Common's privacy reference and the official policy registered as `cvpr-2027-author-guidelines`. Keep generic dimensions below separate from a verified official scoring form.

Primary dimensions: novelty, technical quality, empirical validation, visual evidence, clarity, and fair comparison.

Review emphasis:

- Treat figures, qualitative examples, failure cases, and visual comparisons as evidence, not decoration.
- Inspect the closest relevant baselines and fair protocol; request ablations, cross-dataset tests, or robustness checks when required by the paper's specific claims.
- Penalize cherry-picked visuals, missing failure analysis, low-resolution or unreadable figures, and unclear relation to close CV work.
- Reward inspectable evidence and concise claims tied to benchmarks and visual examples.

## KDD / SIGMOD / VLDB / ICDE / SIGIR

Primary dimensions: realistic problem setting, novelty, effectiveness, efficiency, scalability, system or algorithm detail, and user/data utility.

Review emphasis:

- Require realistic workloads, datasets, query/search/user scenarios, and deployment constraints.
- Evaluate both effectiveness and efficiency when both are claimed.
- Penalize toy-only evidence, missing indexes/pipeline details, unclear complexity, and weak large-scale validation.

## Systems / Architecture / Networking / Storage

Primary dimensions: real problem, design soundness, implementation detail, evaluation realism, end-to-end impact, and operational boundaries.

Review emphasis:

- Start from bottlenecks, workloads, deployment pain, or hardware/network constraints.
- Require implementation specifics, baselines, sensitivity studies, overheads, and realistic workloads.
- Penalize benchmark artifacts, unrealistic assumptions, and missing failure modes.

## Security / Privacy / Cryptography

Primary dimensions: threat model, novelty, correctness, practical impact, responsible disclosure, and formal or empirical security evidence.

Review emphasis:

- Define attacker, defender, assumptions, scope, and guarantees early.
- For attacks, prove real-world impact and handle disclosure/ethics.
- For defenses, test bypasses, false positives/negatives, deployment constraints, and residual risk.
- For cryptography, prioritize definitions, assumptions, proof structure, and theorem readability.

## Software Engineering / PL / Formal Methods

Primary dimensions: problem precision, formal or empirical soundness, tool usefulness, scalability, developer relevance, and threats to validity.

Review emphasis:

- Define programs, properties, language features, or developer tasks precisely.
- For empirical SE, check dataset construction, baselines, metrics, statistical practice, and threats to validity.
- For PL/FM, require proof roadmaps, assumptions, soundness/completeness boundaries, and auditability.

## HCI / CSCW / UbiComp / UIST

Primary dimensions: research question, human problem, study design, analysis validity, ethics, and design/system contribution.

Review emphasis:

- Connect research questions to methods, participants, measures, analysis, and claims.
- For qualitative work, check coding, themes, triangulation, and reflexivity.
- For systems, keep interaction design and user value central.
- Penalize unsupported broad claims from narrow populations.

## Graphics / Visualization / Multimedia / VR

Primary dimensions: visual or perceptual contribution, technical pipeline, comparison quality, user/perceptual evidence, and generalization.

Review emphasis:

- Make visual improvement inspectable through high-quality figures or demos.
- Combine metrics with qualitative evidence and user/perceptual studies when needed.
- Penalize cherry-picked media, weak comparisons, and unclear visual advantage.

## Theory

Primary dimensions: correctness, nontriviality, novelty, precision, relation to known barriers, and proof readability.

Review emphasis:

- State model, assumptions, theorems, and contribution boundaries early.
- Give intuition before dense proof detail.
- Penalize unclear assumptions, missing proof steps, and overclaiming beyond theorem statements.
