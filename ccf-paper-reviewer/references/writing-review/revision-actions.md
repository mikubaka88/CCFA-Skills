# Revision Actions

Use this file to convert evidence-backed writing-review findings into concrete improvements. Diagnose the actual confusion, revise its cause, and close it when the affected text and evidence satisfy the stated condition.

Before producing a revision plan, load `review-checklists.md` in this directory and apply its writing-revision checks. Scientific re-scoring or acceptance-style judgment selects the scientific/full mode of this same reviewer skill; writing perspectives alone keep writing scope. Requested manuscript edits belong to `ccf-paper-writer`.

## Action Classes

Classify every issue:

- Writing-fixable: contribution statement, paragraph flow, terminology, figure narration, related-work framing, limitation wording.
- Structure-fixable: reorder sections, move paragraphs, split mixed paragraphs, merge repeated paragraphs, or change section headings.
- Prose-quality: repair empty self-defense, unsupported hype, or a demonstrated explanation/readability problem; keep scientifically useful notation, qualifications, and structure.
- Claim-qualification: weaken, scope, move, or support claims that currently exceed evidence.
- Analysis-fixable: add deeper explanation, error analysis, complexity analysis, sensitivity analysis, qualitative analysis, or proof intuition using existing results.
- Citation/positioning: add close related work and explain the technical difference, not just a citation.
- Figure/table: improve readability, captions, grouping, visual examples, failure cases, or main-text signposting.
- LaTeX/format: fix template, labels, references, citations, captions, equations, algorithms, package conflicts, or spacing/style violations.
- Compression: cut redundant background, move detail to appendix, merge paragraphs, shorten captions, or reduce repetitive result narration.
- Reproducibility: add pseudocode, implementation details, hyperparameters, dataset splits, metrics, code/data availability, artifact notes.
- Requires-new-result: new baseline, ablation, dataset, theorem, user study, measurement, statistical test, or deployment evaluation.
- Accepted-limitation: disclose a material unresolved boundary and its consequence; lack of time or an imagined objection does not itself establish a scientific limitation.
- Venue-mismatch: change framing, track, or target venue.

## Deduction-To-Action Map

The actions below are options matched to an established defect, not a checklist to execute in full. A request for more caution, a lower score, or reviewer preference does not justify a new qualifier, experiment, or smaller objective by itself. Identify the factual or logical gap first; retain supported wording when the requested hedge adds no information.

### Contribution unclear

Reviewer deduction: "I cannot tell what is new."

Actions:

- Add a one-sentence contribution claim in Abstract and early Introduction.
- State contribution type: method, theory, dataset, benchmark, system, analysis, study, resource, or negative result.
- Separate "what is new" from "what is inherited from prior work."
- Add a contribution table only if it clarifies close comparisons.

### Novelty weak

Reviewer deduction: "This appears incremental or already known."

Actions:

- Identify the closest prior work and write the exact difference.
- Avoid claiming first-ever unless verified.
- Describe the contribution actually supported by the work, whether insight, formulation, evidence, scale, efficiency, or integration. Changing its label cannot create novelty.
- Add missing citations or baseline comparisons.

### Significance unclear

Reviewer deduction: "Why should this venue care?"

Actions:

- Tie the problem to a concrete community bottleneck.
- Show who will use the result and what new capability or understanding it enables.
- Replace broad motivation with field-specific stakes.
- Add a "why now" sentence if the problem is timely.

### Soundness risk

Reviewer deduction: "Claims may not be technically valid."

Actions:

- State assumptions and boundaries explicitly.
- Add proof sketch, derivation, algorithmic invariant, threat model, statistical test, or study-design justification.
- Remove or weaken claims that exceed the evidence.
- Add a limitation if the concern is real but bounded.

### Evidence weak

Reviewer deduction: "The evaluation does not support the main claim."

Actions:

- Map each claim to an experiment/proof/study.
- Select the comparison, analysis, proof, or study that resolves the identified evidence gap, reusing existing results where sufficient.
- If no new result can be added, narrow the claim to what current evidence supports.
- Put the most decision-relevant evidence in the main text, not only appendix.

### Baseline or related work missing

Reviewer deduction: "Comparison is incomplete."

Actions:

- Add a missing relevant strong comparison when the scientific claim needs it; distinguish the matching setting and protocol from a merely newer or higher-scoring method.
- Use fair protocols and report comparable metrics.
- Add a close-related-work paragraph that explains differences in task, assumption, method, or evidence.
- Avoid dismissive wording about prior work.

### Ablation missing

Reviewer deduction: "The proposed components are not justified."

Actions:

- Establish what component-level claim needs support, then use an ablation, controlled variant, proof, or analysis that can distinguish the proposed explanation.
- If an ablation is impossible or inappropriate, inspect whether another evidence form already resolves the claim. State a limitation only for a material gap that remains; inability to perform one particular test is not automatically a limitation.
- Explain how each component connects to the central insight.

### Reproducibility gap

Reviewer deduction: "I cannot reproduce or audit the result."

Actions:

- Add pseudocode, hyperparameters, dataset preprocessing, split details, metrics, hardware, training schedule, random seeds, and artifact availability.
- Reference appendix/code clearly from the main paper.
- Add details for negative or failed experiments if they affect interpretation.

### Clarity and story weak

Reviewer deduction: "The paper is hard to follow."

Actions:

- Connect the task, gap, insight, mechanism, and relevant evidence into the scientific takeaway. Place material assumptions and observed limits where they affect interpretation; do not require a limitation ending.
- Make each paragraph carry one message.
- Stabilize terminology across sections.
- Use figures and captions to explain mechanism and evidence.

### Paragraph logic broken

Reviewer deduction: "This paragraph mixes roles or does not advance the argument."

Actions:

- Identify the paragraph's main message and the related roles that develop it: motivation, explanation, evidence, comparison, or transition. Several coherent roles can support one message.
- Split unrelated arguments; keep a claim with the explanation or evidence that develops it.
- Move details to the section where a reviewer expects them.
- Replace vague transition sentences with the specific logical link to the next paragraph.

### Prose anti-patterns present

Reviewer deduction: "The writing sounds mechanical, defensive, or artificially structured."

Actions:

- Replace unexplained or unnecessary labels with the scientific objects and relations; preserve useful research-question and cross-reference identifiers.
- Rewrite manuscript narration when it displaces the actual scientific explanation.
- Split compound sentences when their combined roles obscure the relation between ideas.
- Repair punctuation-heavy chains when their relationships are unclear, preserving useful parallelism, contrast, and connected reasoning.
- Move formula-heavy derivations to appendix unless they are necessary for first-pass understanding.
- Explain what an abstract's numbers mean when their role is unclear. Preserve a result-led opening when the measured quantity or bound carries the contribution; no fixed abstract sequence is required.
- Remove repeated concept definitions and choose one canonical term.
- Replace empty ability labels such as “可验证的路径” with the specific object, operation, or relation being proposed. Preserve technical feasibility and verifiability statements when they answer the actual research question.
- For repeated “比起”, `rather than`, or qualifiers, identify the real comparison or condition. Rebuild the positive argument when these phrases supply no information; do not substitute synonyms merely to pass a pattern check.

### LaTeX or format risk

Reviewer deduction: "The submission looks careless or may violate venue rules."

Actions:

- Fix template mode, anonymization/camera-ready settings, page limits, and appendix placement.
- Resolve undefined references, duplicate labels, missing citations, and stale figure/table references.
- Remove style-breaking spacing hacks unless the venue template permits them.
- Make captions self-contained and ensure tables/figures remain readable without excessive scaling.

### Terminology or notation inconsistent

Reviewer deduction: "I cannot tell whether these terms refer to the same object."

Actions:

- Choose one canonical term for each concept and use it throughout.
- Define symbols before first use and reuse notation consistently.
- Align abstract, introduction, method, experiments, and conclusion wording for the same contribution.
- Add a notation table only if the method section is notation-heavy.

### Overclaim

Reviewer deduction: "The paper overstates its result."

Actions:

- Replace universal language with scoped language.
- Move speculative claims to limitations or discussion.
- Add conditions under which the method works or fails.
- Align Abstract and Conclusion claims with actual evidence.

### Venue mismatch

Reviewer deduction: "This is not a good fit for the venue."

Actions:

- Reframe around the venue's audience and evidence standards.
- Move application details behind the technical contribution if targeting AI/ML.
- Move technical novelty behind user value if targeting HCI.
- Consider a different venue if the contribution type cannot fit.

## Revision Acceptance

After revision, ask:

1. Is the diagnosed ambiguity, omission, or unsupported statement resolved at its actual location?
2. Does each major claim have visible evidence?
3. Are the closest baselines and related works handled?
4. Are limitations honest and bounded?
5. Is the evidence needed for the affected claim visible or clearly referenced, using the appropriate contribution type and any verified venue requirements?
6. Does the paragraph develop a clear message through connected sentences?
7. Does the revised prose explain the science directly while preserving necessary uncertainty, notation, and useful structure?
8. Are labels, citations, captions, notation, and format issues actually fixed in source?

Mark an issue fixed when its concrete acceptance condition is met. Score movement is not a closure condition. Re-score only when requested; reopen a closed issue for new evidence or an actual remaining defect, not to obtain a more reassuring assessment.
