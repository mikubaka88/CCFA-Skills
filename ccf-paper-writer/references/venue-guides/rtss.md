## Usage Boundary

- Use this file for domain writing guidance. Annual submission rules are resolved through `ccf-submission-checker`, not copied from historical templates.
- Use `ccf-paper-writer` for actual paper writing and polishing.
- Use `ccf-paper-reviewer` or `ccf-submission-checker` for format audit, depending on whether the task is manuscript-facing or submission-package-facing.
- Match the exact year/track/stage before applying any format change; reuse current verified official rules and preserve supplied verified templates.

1. **Abstract** — Problem, solution, timing guarantees summary
2. **Introduction** — Real-time problem, system model, contributions (enumerate explicitly)
3. **System Model & Assumptions** — Task model, platform, timing parameters
4. **Problem Statement** — Formal problem definition with notation
5. **Proposed Approach** — Scheduling algorithm, resource allocation, etc.
6. **Theoretical Analysis** — Schedulability analysis, WCET bounds, proofs

## Real-Time Formalism

RTSS papers require rigorous timing and schedulability analysis:

```latex
\section{System Model}
We consider a real-time task set $\tau$ executed on a uniprocessor
under preemptive fixed-priority scheduling.

\subsection{Task Model}
Each task $\tau_i$ is characterized by:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Period $T_i$: the minimum time between successive job releases
  \item Execution time $C_i$: the worst-case execution time (WCET)
  \item Relative deadline $D_i$: typically $D_i \leq T_i$
  \item Priority $p_i$: higher values indicate higher priorities
\end{itemize}

A task set $\tau$ is said to be \emph{feasible} if there exists a
schedule such that all tasks meet their deadlines under all possible
job releases and execution times bounded by their WCETs.
```

## Schedulability Analysis

Core to RTSS papers is the schedulability analysis:

```latex
\section{Schedulability Analysis}

\begin{main*}[Sufficient Schedulability Test]
  \label[main*]{thm:schedulability}
  A task set $\tau$ is schedulable under FPPS if for all tasks $\tau_i$:
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:response-time}
    R_i = C_i + \sum_{\forall \tau_j \in hp(i)} \left\lceil
      \frac{R_i}{T_j} \right\rceil C_j \leq D_i
  \end{equation}
  where $hp(i)$ denotes the set of tasks with higher priority than $\tau_i$,
  and $R_i$ is the worst-case response time of $\tau_i$.
\end{main*}

\begin{Proof}
  The proof proceeds by computing the worst-case response time
  iteratively using the recurrence relation of \autoref{eq:response-time}.
  Since $R_i$ is monotonically non-decreasing and bounded by $D_i$,
  the algorithm terminates with either $R_i \leq D_i$ for all tasks
  (proving schedulability) or $R_i > D_i$ for some task (proving infeasibility).
\end{Proof}
```

## Worst-Case Execution Time (WCET)

```latex
\section{WCET Analysis}

We compute WCET bounds using abstract interpretation~\citep{absint}.
Our analysis operates on the control flow graph (CFG) of the program:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Flow facts}: Loop bounds derived from induction variable
    analysis; infeasible paths eliminated using constraint solving
  \item \textbf{Cache analysis}: Abstract interpretation of the cache
    state using the must/may analysis framework
  \item \textbf{Pipeline analysis}: Implicit path enumeration with
    pipeline hazard modeling
\end{itemize}

The final WCET estimate is the maximum over all paths:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:wcet}
  C_i = \max_{p \in \text{paths}(cfg)} \left(
    \sum_{b \in p} C_b^{cache} + C_b^{pipeline} \right)
\end{equation}
```

## Algorithm Formatting

```latex
\begin{algorithm}[t]
\caption{Rate-Monotonic Scheduling with Server}
\label[algorithm]{alg:rms-server}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\REQUIRE Task set $\tau = \{\tau_1, \dots, \tau_n\}$, server budget $Q_s$, period $T_s$
\ENSURE Feasibility check and schedule
\STATE Sort tasks by period (shorter periods = higher priority)
\STATE $t \gets 0$, $Q \gets Q_s$, $T \gets 0$
\WHILE{$\text{all tasks pending}$}
  \STATE $R \gets$ current ready queue (sorted by priority)
  \IF{$R \neq \emptyset$ and $Q > 0$}
    \STATE Execute highest-priority task $\tau_i$ for $\delta = \min(Q, C_i - C_i^{exec})$
    \STATE $C_i^{exec} \gets C_i^{exec} + \delta$, $Q \gets Q - \delta$
  \ELSIF{$Q = 0$}
    \STATE Execute background tasks
  \ENDIF
  \IF{$T = T_s$}
    \STATE $Q \gets Q_s$, $T \gets 0$
  \ENDIF
\ENDWHILE
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
```

## Experimental Evaluation

RTSS evaluation combines analysis with empirical results:

```latex
\section{Evaluation}
We evaluate our approach using both analysis-based bounds and
implementation on a real-time testbed.

\subsection{Simulation Setup}
We simulate 10,000 randomly generated task sets with:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Number of tasks: 5--20
  \item Total utilization: 50\%--95\% (uniform distribution)
  \item Periods: drawn from log-uniform distribution in [10ms, 1000ms]
  \item Deadline type: constrained ($D_i = T_i$)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Results}
\autoref{tab:acceptance} shows the acceptance ratio (fraction of
feasible task sets correctly identified as feasible) for different
utilization levels. Our test achieves 94.3\% acceptance ratio at
80\% utilization, compared to 87.2\% for the baseline test.
