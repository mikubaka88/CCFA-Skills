# TCC Venue Guide

> Migrated from the legacy `ccf-conference-skills/tcc/SKILL.md` runtime skill during v0.4.0. This file is now reference material for `ccf-paper-writer` and `ccf-submission-checker`, not a standalone skill.

## Usage Boundary

- Use this file for LaTeX, page limit, anonymity, template, camera-ready, rebuttal-template, and venue-format details.
- Use `ccf-paper-writer` for actual paper writing and polishing.
- Use `ccf-paper-reviewer` or `ccf-submission-checker` for format audit, depending on whether the task is manuscript-facing or submission-package-facing.
- Verify current-year official rules before final submission.

## Page Limits

| Section | Limit |
|---------|-------|
| Main paper | **30 pages** (LNCS standard) |
| References | Included in page count |
| Appendix | Typically included |

TCC follows LNCS guidelines with approximately 30 pages (including references). Check the specific Call for Papers for the current year's limit.

## Anonymity Requirements

TCC uses double-blind review:

1. No author names or affiliations in submission
2. Use third person for self-citations: "Smith et al. showed..." not "we showed..."
3. Anonymize all URLs (e.g., ePrint links with author names)
4. Clear PDF metadata
5. Remove acknowledgments from submission

## Camera-Ready Differences

After acceptance:

1. Add complete author information with affiliations
2. Include acknowledgments
3. Add footnote for contact author
4. Ensure PDF/A compliance for Springer publication

## Section Organization

TCC papers follow the theoretical cryptography structure:

1. **Introduction** — Problem, contributions (enumerate contributions)
2. **Technical Overview** — High-level summary of the approach
3. **Preliminaries** — Definitions, notation, complexity classes
4. **Main Results** — Core theoretical contribution
5. **Technical Details** — Proofs, constructions, lower bounds
6. **Related Work / Discussion** — Positioning against prior work
7. **References**

TCC papers emphasize **mathematical rigor** and **precise complexity assumptions**.

## Theoretical Cryptography Conventions

TCC focuses on complexity-theoretic foundations:

### Complexity Assumptions

```latex
\section{Preliminaries}

\subsection{Complexity Assumptions}
We rely on the following assumptions:

\begin{assumption}[Decisional Diffie-Hellman (DDH)]
Given a prime $p$, generator $g$ of $\mathbb{G}_q$,
and tuple $(g^a, g^b, g^c) \in \mathbb{G}_q^3$, the
DDH assumption states that:
\begin{align}
  \Pr[\mathcal{A}(g^a, g^b, g^{ab}) = 1] - 
  \Pr[\mathcal{A}(g^a, g^b, g^c) = 1] \leq \negl(\lambda)
\end{align}
for all PPT adversaries $\mathcal{A}$.
\end{assumption}

Weaker assumptions (used in some constructions):
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{CDH}: Computational Diffie-Hellman
  \item \textbf{DLOG}: Discrete logarithm
  \item \textbf{LWE}: Learning with Errors
\end{itemize}
```

### Protocol Composition

```latex
\section{Protocol Construction}

\subsection{Universal Composability}
We prove our protocol UC-secure in the $\mathcal{F}_{\text{CRS}}$
hybrid model. The protocol proceeds in three phases:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Commit phase}: The sender commits to the message
    using a statistically binding commitment scheme
  \item \textbf{Open phase}: The sender reveals the opening
    using a zero-knowledge proof
  \item \textbf{Verify phase}: The receiver verifies the proof
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Theorem [Main Result]}
\textbf{Protocol $\Pi$ UC-realizes the ideal functionality
$\mathcal{F}_{\text{OT}}$ in the $\mathcal{F}_{\text{CRS}}$-
hybrid model, assuming DDH.}

\begin{Proof sketch}
We construct an efficient simulator $\Sim$:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $\Sim$ intercepts all messages from the environment
    $\mathcal{Z}$ to the adversary $\mathcal{A}$
  \item $\Sim$ extracts the committed values from the
    statistically binding commitments using the rewinding technique
  \item $\Sim$ programs the CRS to extract the witness for
    the zero-knowledge proof
  \item $\Sim$ forwards the extracted values to $\mathcal{F}_{\text{OT}}$
    and simulates the receiver's view
\end{itemize}
The indistinguishability follows from the DDH assumption...
\end{Proof sketch}
```

### Lower Bounds

```latex
\section{Lower Bounds}

\subsection{Theorem [Main Lower Bound]}
\textbf{Any black-box construction of [primitive] from
[assumption] requires at least $\Omega(n^2)$ communication.}

\begin{Proof}
Assume there exists a black-box construction $\Pi$ achieving
the claimed functionality with $o(n^2)$ communication.
We show this leads to a contradiction with [known lower bound]:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Consider an adversary $\mathcal{A}$ that interacts with
    $\Pi$ and makes $q$ queries to the protocol
  \item By the black-box lower bound technique of [CITATION],
    $\mathcal{A}$ can recover the secret using $q \cdot \text{poly}(n)$
    time
  \item If $q = o(n^2)$, then total time is $o(n^3)$, which
    contradicts the assumed $\Omega(n^3)$ hardness of [problem]
\end{enumerate}
\end{Proof}
```

## Figures and Tables

- Include complexity hierarchies, reduction diagrams, and comparison tables

```latex
\begin{figure}[t]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.85\linewidth]{figs/hierarchy}
  \caption{Complexity hierarchy of cryptographic assumptions.
    Arrows indicate implication (stronger $\to$ weaker).
    Dashed boxes indicate post-quantum assumptions.
    Our new assumption $\Pi$ lies in the shaded region,
    incomparable with LWE but implied by DDH.}
