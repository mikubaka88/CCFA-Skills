# VR Venue Guide

> Migrated from the legacy `ccf-conference-skills/vr/SKILL.md` runtime skill during v0.4.0. This file is now reference material for `ccf-paper-writer` and `ccf-submission-checker`, not a standalone skill.

## Usage Boundary

- Use this file for domain writing guidance. Annual submission rules are resolved through `ccf-submission-checker`, not copied from historical templates.
- Use `ccf-paper-writer` for actual paper writing and polishing.
- Use `ccf-paper-reviewer` or `ccf-submission-checker` for format audit, depending on whether the task is manuscript-facing or submission-package-facing.
- Match the exact year/track/stage before applying any format change; reuse current verified official rules and preserve supplied verified templates.

## Section Organization

VR papers typically follow a human-centered VR research structure:

1. **Abstract** — Concise summary
2. **Introduction** — VR/AR problem, user experience challenge, contributions
3. **Background & Related Work** — VR/AR foundations, prior systems
4. **System Design** — Hardware setup, software architecture
5. **User Study / Evaluation** — Methodology, participants, tasks, metrics
6. **Results** — Quantitative and qualitative findings
7. **Discussion** — Implications, limitations, design guidelines
8. **Conclusion**
9. References
10. Appendix (optional)

## VR/AR-Specific Content

### Hardware Setup Description

VR papers require detailed hardware descriptions:

```latex
\section{System Design}
\subsection{Hardware Configuration}
We implemented the system on an Oculus Quest 3 headset running at
90 Hz refresh rate with a display resolution of 2064x2208 pixels
per eye. The participant's position was tracked using the headset's
inside-out tracking system with sub-millimeter accuracy.
The application was developed in Unity 2023.2 with the XR Interaction
Toolkit. Audio feedback was delivered via the headset's integrated
speakers with head-related transfer function (HRTF) processing.
```

### User Study Methodology

VR papers require rigorous user study methodology:

```latex
\section{Evaluation}
\subsection{Participants}
We recruited 24 participants (12 female, 12 male, age $M=28.3$, $SD=4.2$)
from the university community. All participants had normal or
corrected-to-normal vision and reported no history of motion sickness.
Participants were randomly assigned to two conditions in a between-subjects
design. Sample size was determined via power analysis ($\alpha=0.05$, power=0.8$).

\subsection{Procedure}
After providing informed consent, participants completed a demographic
questionnaire and a simulator sickness questionnaire (SSQ) baseline.
They then underwent a 5-minute training period followed by the main
experimental task. After each condition, participants completed the
SSQ, the presence questionnaire (PQ), and a subjective preference questionnaire.

\subsection{Metrics}
We measured: (1) task completion time, (2) error rate, (3) SSQ scores,
(4) presence questionnaire (PQ) scores, and (5) subjective preference rankings.
```

## Presence and Simulator Sickness

VR papers commonly report standardized questionnaires:

```latex
% Common VR metrics to report:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Simulator Sickness Questionnaire (SSQ)}: Kennedy et al.
  \item \textbf{Presence Questionnaire (PQ)}: Slater et al.
  \item \textbf{ITQ (Immersive Tendency Questionnaire)}: Slater et al.
  \item \textbf{SSQ subscales}: Nausea, Oculomotor, Disorientation
\end{itemize}
```

## Figures and Tables

- Grayscale legibility required
- Use high-resolution figures (minimum 300 DPI)
- Include hardware setup photos when relevant

```latex
\begin{figure}[t]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{figs/system-setup}
  \caption{The VR training system setup showing: (a) the head-mounted
    display with hand controllers, (b) the tracked workspace boundaries,
    and (c) the experimenter's monitoring station.}
