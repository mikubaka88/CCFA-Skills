# CCFA Skills Catalog

This catalog is the public trigger-conflict index for the current CCFA family. If this document conflicts with a skill's `SKILL.md`, `SKILL.md` is authoritative.

## Merged Entries

| --- | --- | --- |
| `ccf-workflow-planner` | `ccf-pipeline-orchestrator` | Planning and orchestration are the same project-control layer. |
| `ccf-paper-compressor` | `ccf-paper-writer` | Compression changes manuscript text and must share writing safeguards. |
| `ccf-writing-reviewer` | `ccf-paper-reviewer` | Writing review is a review mode, not a separate runtime owner. |
| `ccf-citation-auditor` | `ccf-integrity-auditor` | Citation verification is evidence integrity. |

| `ccf-artifact-packager` | `ccf-submission-checker` | Artifact readiness is submission readiness. |
| `ccf-venue-format-guide` | `ccf-submission-checker` | Venue format lookup is a submission gate; writing still reads venue references. |

## Conflict Rules

![Routing boundaries](../assets/ccfa-skills-routing.svg)

- Non-review workflow skills should follow the user's requested output shape. Their internal checklists are safeguards, not mandatory visible report templates.
- Every CCFA skill receives `ccf-humanization` first and `ccf-common` second. Reuse applicable active rules across contributors without recursive startup. Detailed rewriting and experiment checks remain conditional; assessment-only work preserves the assessed artifact and rigorous criticism. Specialist ownership and explicit scope remain intact.
- Review, audit, and submission-gate skills may remain structured because their job is traceable diagnosis and pass/fail risk control.
- Full-workflow and full-paper prompts should produce dense artifacts, not route summaries. A manuscript request should leave a manuscript; a closed-loop request should leave idea review, writing draft, review, audit, rebuttal, and submission-check artifacts.
- Idea exploration, rescue, and shaping go to `ccf-idea-optimizer`; concept judgment, including natural questions without score wording, goes to `ccf-idea-reviewer`. Route by the requested judgment even when a full manuscript is supplied. Idea and paper reports use separate detailed review structures by default, with brief output on explicit request; only manuscript scientific review evaluates experiment completeness by default.
- Recent-paper watching, competitor tracking, and "is there a new similar idea?" go to `ccf-literature-monitor`; deep related-work discovery and opportunity mapping go to `ccf-literature-searcher`; existing citation verification goes to `ccf-integrity-auditor`.
- In early research, a weak or crowded direction should produce rescue routes, narrowing options, and evidence-to-decide before `abandon` is used.
- Manuscript rewriting, compression, and presentation outputs go to `ccf-paper-writer`; judgment goes to `ccf-paper-reviewer`.
- PDF-to-exemplar conversion goes to `ccf-paper-to-exemplar`; actual manuscript drafting still goes to `ccf-paper-writer`.
- From-scratch submission manuscripts must be length-aware: underfilled drafts stay with `ccf-paper-writer` for expansion; overfilled drafts stay with `ccf-paper-writer` for compression; final page compliance goes to `ccf-submission-checker`.
- Real result/evidence structure goes to `ccf-experiment-designer`; publication-grade data figures and research method/architecture diagrams, including GPT Image 2-first drafts and optional editable SVG/PDF/PPTX reconstruction, go to `ccf-visual-composer`; repository documentation diagrams go to `ccf-skill-forger`.
- Venue requirements, package checks, anonymity, and artifact readiness go to `ccf-submission-checker`.
- Reviewer responses, revision ledgers, and resubmission plans go to `ccf-rebuttal-writer`.

## Venue Guides

The legacy per-venue runtime layer remains reference-only:

- `ccf-paper-writer/references/venue-guides/index.md`
- `ccf-paper-writer/references/venue-guides/<venue>.md`

Use `ccf-paper-writer` for venue-aware manuscript text and `ccf-submission-checker` for venue/package compliance.

All file-producing modes follow the shared artifact contract: existing destinations first, stable task/artifact working directories, current-file updates, and preserved source evidence. A local visual update reuses its editable source and assets. Reference loading and checks are scoped to the current mode and affected dependencies; full requested scientific coverage is preserved.
